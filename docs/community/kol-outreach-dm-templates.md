# ozskr.ai KOL Outreach DM Templates

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026
**Status:** Ready for Execution

---

## Overview

This document contains three DM template variants for KOL outreach. Each template is designed for Twitter/X DMs with a 280-character target for initial messages (some may exceed slightly for clarity).

**Tone Guidelines:**
- Peer-to-peer, not salesy
- Technical depth without jargon overload
- Genuine interest in their work (always personalize the opening line)
- Clear value proposition and specific ask
- $HOPE mentions include utility disclaimers

**Personalization Rules:**
- ALWAYS reference specific recent content from the target account
- NEVER send copy-paste DMs without personalization
- Include a specific reason why you're reaching out to them
- Make the ask clear and easy to respond to

---

## Template 1: Builder-to-Builder

**Use Case:** Reaching out to developers, protocol contributors, and technical creators who value code quality, architecture, and open-source work.

**Target Profiles:** #1 (Full-Stack Solana Dev), #2 (DeFi Contributor), #3 (Wallet Dev), #4 (Security Auditor), #6 (DevTools Advocate), #19 (Claude Code Early Adopter), #20 (Agent Orchestration)

### Initial DM (Personalized Opening Required)

```
Hey [Name], really enjoyed your [specific content reference — e.g., "thread on Jupiter integration patterns" / "breakdown of SIWS implementation" / "security audit checklist"].

I'm building ozskr.ai — an AI influencer platform on Solana. Built entirely with Claude Code (Opus 4.6 orchestrator + specialized subagents). 482 tests, TypeScript strict mode, open-source under MIT.

The interesting part: non-custodial DeFi via Jupiter Ultra, 7-stage content pipeline with automated moderation, and Mem0 memory per agent.

GitHub: github.com/daftpixie/ozskr

Would love your technical feedback if you have 10 minutes to poke around the codebase. Happy to discuss [specific technical angle based on their expertise — e.g., "wallet adapter patterns" / "DeFi integration security" / "agent orchestration architecture"].

Alpha access available if you're interested.

— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~650 (intended to be split across 2-3 messages in a natural flow)

**Shortened Version for Single Message:**

```
Hey [Name], saw your [content]. Building ozskr.ai — AI platform on Solana, built entirely with Claude Code. 482 tests, open-source, non-custodial DeFi. Would value your feedback on [specific technical aspect]. GitHub: github.com/daftpixie/ozskr
```

**Character Count:** ~240

### Follow-Up #1 (3 Days After Initial DM, No Response)

```
Hey [Name], following up on my message about ozskr.ai. Totally understand if you're busy — just wanted to add that the repo has some interesting [specific patterns based on their expertise — e.g., "transaction simulation patterns" / "wallet adapter integration" / "Mastra agent orchestration"].

No pressure, but if you do check it out, I'd genuinely appreciate your thoughts. Alpha access ready whenever.

Link: github.com/daftpixie/ozskr

Cheers,
Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~420

### Follow-Up #2 (After Positive Response)

```
Awesome, thanks for checking it out! Here's alpha access:

1. Visit ozskr.vercel.app
2. Connect your Solana wallet
3. Use wallet [wallet address] — I've added you to the whitelist

Devnet for now (mainnet pending smart contract audit). Happy to walk through any features or answer technical questions.

If you end up creating an agent or testing DeFi flows, I'd love to hear what you think. No obligation to post about it unless it genuinely resonates.

Also — if you want to write a technical deep-dive or comparison post, I can provide architecture diagrams, benchmark data, or whatever would be helpful.

Thanks again!
— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~600

## Template 2: Product Demo Offer

**Use Case:** Reaching out to AI tool reviewers, content creators, and influencers who test and review new products. Focus on early access and hands-on experience.

**Target Profiles:** #9 (AI Agent Framework Tester), #10 (Claude API User), #11 (No-Code AI Builder), #12 (AI Quality Researcher), #13 (AI Ethics Advocate), #14 (Memory Systems Researcher), #15 (Web3 Storyteller)

### Initial DM (Personalized Opening Required)

```
Hey [Name], been following your [specific content reference — e.g., "AI agent reviews" / "comparison of LangChain vs Mastra" / "breakdown of vector memory systems"].

I'm launching ozskr.ai — an AI influencer platform on Solana. The hook: built entirely with Claude Code (AI building AI tools).

Key features:
- Mastra agents + Mem0 memory (isolated per agent)
- 7-stage content pipeline with quality gates + moderation
- Non-custodial DeFi via Jupiter Ultra
- Open-source under MIT (github.com/daftpixie/ozskr)

Alpha is live with a 500-spot waitlist. I'd love to get it in your hands early for feedback. No strings attached — if it's not your thing, no worries.

Interested in testing it out?

— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~650

**Shortened Version for Single Message:**

```
Hey [Name], saw your [content]. Built ozskr.ai — AI platform on Solana, made entirely with Claude Code. Mastra agents, Mem0 memory, 7-stage pipeline, open-source. Alpha live. Want early access to test it out?
```

**Character Count:** ~220

### Follow-Up #1 (3 Days After Initial DM, No Response)

```
Hey [Name], quick follow-up on ozskr.ai. Realized I should mention — the 7-stage content pipeline includes automated moderation before publication (not just quality gates). Might be interesting for your audience since a lot of AI tools skip that step.

Open-source repo: github.com/daftpixie/ozskr
Live demo: ozskr.vercel.app

If you're curious, I can set you up with alpha access. No pressure though!

— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~400

### Follow-Up #2 (After Positive Response)

```
Great! Here's how to get started:

1. Visit ozskr.vercel.app
2. Connect Solana wallet (Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, etc.)
3. Your wallet is whitelisted: [wallet address]

You'll be able to:
- Create AI agents with custom character DNA
- Generate content with real-time streaming UI
- See the 7-stage pipeline in action (parse → context → enhance → generate → quality → moderation → store)

Currently on devnet (SOL is free — just use a devnet faucet). Mainnet coming after beta.

If you create content about it, please mention:
- Platform is in alpha (not production-ready)
- Currently on devnet (not mainnet)
- $HOPE is a utility token for platform features (NOT an investment)

I can provide screenshots, architecture diagrams, or a demo walkthrough if helpful. Let me know what would make your testing easier.

Thanks!
— Matt

## Template 3: Collaboration Pitch

**Use Case:** Reaching out to storytellers, community builders, and creators who value narrative, aesthetics, and collaboration. Focus on co-creating content together.

**Target Profiles:** #5 (Ecosystem News), #8 (Hackathon Winner), #15 (Web3 Storyteller), #16 (NFT Community Builder), #17 (Crypto Meme Account), #18 (Web3 Design Critique)

### Initial DM (Personalized Opening Required)

```
Hey [Name], love your [specific content reference — e.g., "Solana ecosystem coverage" / "build-in-public threads" / "Web3 design breakdowns"].

I'm working on ozskr.ai — an AI influencer platform on Solana with a unique angle: it was built entirely with Claude Code (AI building AI tools). The whole thing is open-source at github.com/daftpixie/ozskr.

We're using Wizard of Oz theming ("Pay no mind to the agents behind the emerald curtain"). The idea: sophisticated AI works behind the scenes, but you maintain full creative control.

Alpha just launched with a 500-spot waitlist. I'd love to collaborate on content with you — whether that's [specific collaboration idea based on their content style — e.g., "a build-in-public thread about the Claude Code workflow" / "creating a custom AI agent for your community" / "a design breakdown of the brand system"].

Interested in exploring this together?

— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~800

**Shortened Version for Single Message:**

```
Hey [Name], love your [content]. Built ozskr.ai with Claude Code — AI platform on Solana with Wizard of Oz theming. Alpha live. Want to collaborate on [specific content idea]? Open-source: github.com/daftpixie/ozskr
```

**Character Count:** ~220

### Follow-Up #1 (3 Days After Initial DM, No Response)

```
Hey [Name], following up on ozskr.ai. I realize collaboration pitches can be vague — here's what I had in mind:

[Specific collaboration offer based on their content style, e.g.:]

FOR STORYTELLERS:
"A 'How AI Built an AI Platform' thread — I can share the actual Claude Code prompts, agent orchestration decisions, and iterative process. Full transparency."

FOR COMMUNITY BUILDERS:
"Create a custom AI agent for your community with character DNA that matches your vibe. I'll walk you through setup and you can generate content with it live."

FOR DESIGNERS:
"A design breakdown of the brand system: Wizard of Oz theming, Solana colors + emerald glow, full CSS variable system. Critique welcome."

No pressure if it's not a fit. Just thought your audience would appreciate the technical depth + narrative angle.

— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~700

### Follow-Up #2 (After Positive Response)

```
Amazing! Let's make this happen. Here's how we can approach it:

**For You:**
- Alpha access to ozskr.ai (whitelist your wallet)
- Any assets you need: screenshots, architecture diagrams, brand guidelines, security audit report
- I can provide the "behind-the-scenes" story: Claude Code prompts, agent orchestration decisions, technical tradeoffs
- If you want to create custom content with an AI agent, I'll help set up character DNA and walk through the pipeline

**From Me:**
- Early feedback on UX, content quality, or any bugs you hit
- Honest coverage (don't sugarcoat it — alpha warts and all)
- Disclosure: mention it's alpha, on devnet, and that I provided early access

**Content Ideas:**
[Tailor to their style, e.g.:]
- Thread: "I tested an AI platform built by AI — here's what I learned"
- Video: "Creating my first AI influencer on Solana"
- Design review: "Wizard of Oz theming in Web3 — a brand breakdown"
- Build-in-public: "48 hours with ozskr.ai — what worked, what didn't"

Sound good? I'll get your wallet whitelisted and send over assets. Let me know what format works best for you.

— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~1,100 (send across multiple messages)

## Special Case: FTC Disclosure Reminder

If a KOL agrees to create content, always include this disclosure reminder:

```
One more thing — FTC compliance reminder:

Please disclose in any content:
1. That I provided you with early access (material connection)
2. That content was generated by AI (AI disclosure requirement)

Example disclosure language:
"Thanks to @ozskr_ai for early alpha access. Content generated using AI agents with human oversight."

Let me know if you have questions about this!
```

**Character Count:** ~380

## General Follow-Up Rules

### When to Follow Up
- **First Follow-Up:** 3 days after initial DM if no response
- **Second Follow-Up:** 5 days after first follow-up if still no response
- **Stop After:** 2 follow-ups with no response (don't be pushy)

### When NOT to Follow Up
- They've explicitly declined or said "not interested"
- They've read the DM but not responded after 2 follow-ups (respect the silence)
- Their recent content suggests they're dealing with personal issues or taking a break
- They've posted about being overwhelmed with DMs

### How to Gracefully Exit
If someone declines or isn't interested:

```
No worries at all, thanks for considering it! If you ever want to check it out down the road, the offer stands. Appreciate your time.

— Matt
```

**Character Count:** ~150

## Response Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I'm interested, but I'm swamped right now"

```
Totally understand! No rush. I'll keep your wallet address on the whitelist so you can jump in whenever you have time. Just visit ozskr.vercel.app and connect your wallet when you're ready.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions later.

— Matt
```

### Scenario 2: "Can you pay me for a post?"

```
Hey [Name], appreciate your interest! Right now we're in alpha and not doing paid partnerships — focused on getting genuine feedback from early testers.

That said, if you test it out and genuinely like it, I'm happy to support organic content with assets, data, or anything else that's helpful. No pressure though!

Let me know if unpaid early access still interests you.

— Matt
```

### Scenario 3: "Is this on mainnet? I don't want to cover devnet projects."

```
Totally fair! We're on devnet right now — mainnet deployment is planned after beta testing and smart contract audit (budgeted at $15-30K for the Auto-Stake contract).

If you'd prefer to wait until mainnet, I can circle back when we launch. Or if you're open to covering it as an "alpha spotlight" with clear devnet disclosure, I can set you up now.

Your call!

— Matt
```

### Scenario 4: "What's in it for me? Why should I post about this?"

```
Hey [Name], totally fair question. Here's my thinking:

**For Your Audience:**
- First look at a technically interesting project (AI built by AI, 482 tests, open-source)
- Educational value (7-stage content pipeline, non-custodial DeFi patterns, Mastra + Mem0 architecture)
- Wizard of Oz theming is unique in the space

**For You:**
- Early access before the 500-person waitlist fills
- Behind-the-scenes access to the build process (Claude Code prompts, agent orchestration)
- Content collaboration (I can help with assets, data, technical deep-dives)

But if it's not a fit for your audience, no worries! I'd rather you only post about it if it genuinely resonates.

— Matt
```

## $HOPE Token Messaging Rules

If a KOL asks about $HOPE, use this approved language:

### Approved Language

```
$HOPE is ozskr.ai's utility token. It unlocks premium features, tier benefits, and platform governance participation.

IMPORTANT: $HOPE is NOT an investment. It doesn't promise returns, yield, or price appreciation. It's strictly for accessing platform functionality.

See docs/legal/token-disclaimer.md in the repo for full details.
```

### DO NOT Say
- "$HOPE will increase in value"
- "$HOPE is an investment opportunity"
- "$HOPE provides returns"
- "Buy $HOPE before the price goes up"
- Any language implying financial upside

### DO Say
- "$HOPE unlocks premium features"
- "Earn $HOPE through platform activity"
- "Utility token for the ozskr ecosystem"
- "Hold $HOPE to access tier benefits"
