## Notes on Profile Matching

When matching these descriptive profiles to real accounts, prioritize:

1. **Engagement Rate Over Follower Count:** A creator with 2K highly engaged followers is better than 10K inactive followers.
2. **Content Quality:** Look for thoughtful analysis, not just retweets and memes.
3. **Recent Activity:** Active in the last 7 days. Dormant accounts won't convert.
4. **Alignment with Values:** Open-source advocates, build-in-public culture, technical depth.
5. **Audience Overlap:** Their followers should be potential ozskr.ai users (builders, creators, Web3-native).

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Pure hype accounts with no technical substance
- Accounts that only post promotional content
- Heavy shilling of low-quality projects
- Engagement farming (follow-for-follow, engagement pods)
- Accounts that frequently delete content (sign of low conviction)
