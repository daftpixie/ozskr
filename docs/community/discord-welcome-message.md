## First Introduction Example (Matt)

Post this in #introductions BEFORE any community members join to set the tone:

```
Hey everyone — Matt here, founder of ozskr.ai. 👋

**What excites me about AI agents:**
I've been obsessed with the idea that AI can extend human creativity, not replace it. Your AI agent isn't "you" — it's a tool that amplifies your voice, your ideas, your vision. Like the Wizard of Oz, the magic isn't in the curtain — it's in the person behind it.

**What I'm building:**
A platform where anyone (dev or not) can spin up an AI agent that creates content, trades on Solana DEXs, and builds on-chain influence. Think: "AI influencer studio meets DeFi playground."

**My background:**
Built in Web3 for 3 years. Solana native. Claude Code obsessed. Wizard of Oz superfan (obviously). I believe in building in public, even when it's messy.

**What I'm hoping to learn from you:**
What features do you ACTUALLY need? What's confusing? What's delightful? This alpha is as much yours as it is mine.

Let's build something magical. 🪄

— Matt
```

### Example 1: Hitting 100 Members

```
🎉 **100 members!**

We just hit 100 people in this Discord.

When we started a week ago, it was just the team and a few brave alpha testers.

Now we're 100 strong. That's 100 people who believe AI agents + Solana = magic.

**Thank you** for being here. For testing. For reporting bugs. For building in public with us.

Here's to the next 100. And the next 1,000. And beyond.

We're not in Kansas anymore. 🌪️

— The ozskr Team
```

### Example 2: Halloween (Brand-Appropriate)

```
🎃 **Happy Halloween from the Emerald City!**

Tonight, the veil between worlds is thin. Pay extra close attention to the agents behind the curtain. 👀

**Spooky question:** What's the scariest bug you've encountered on ozskr? Drop it below. 🕷️

Best answer gets a shoutout in tomorrow's #announcements.

Stay magical (and spooky). 🪄

## Tone Guidelines for All Messages

### Do's:
- Use active voice ("We shipped X" not "X was shipped")
- Be conversational ("Hey!" not "Greetings, user.")
- Use emojis sparingly (1-3 per message, not every line)
- Reference Wizard of Oz naturally (don't force it)
- Be honest about failures ("We broke auth. Fixed it. Here's why.")

### Don'ts:
- Don't use corporate speak ("We are pleased to announce...")
- Don't over-emoji (🔥🚀💎🌟 every sentence)
- Don't hide bad news (transparency builds trust)
- Don't make promises you can't keep ("This will NEVER break again")
