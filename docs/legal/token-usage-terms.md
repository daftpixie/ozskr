## 1. Overview

This document describes how $HOPE tokens are accepted as payment for services on the ozskr.ai Platform ("Platform"). By using $HOPE tokens to access Platform services, you agree to the terms below.

These Token Usage Terms supplement and are incorporated into the ozskr.ai Terms of Service.

## 2. Token-Based Payment for Services

### 2.1 What $HOPE Pays For

$HOPE tokens may be used to pay for the following Platform services:

- AI content generation credits (text via Claude API, images via fal.ai)
- Premium AI agent features and enhanced character capabilities
- Priority processing and elevated rate limits
- Advanced analytics and performance tracking
- Additional platform features as they become available

### 2.2 How Payment Works

- Service pricing is denominated in $HOPE and displayed before each transaction
- Token payment is deducted at the time of service use
- Deductions occur on-chain via your connected wallet with explicit confirmation
- The Platform never holds or custodies tokens on your behalf — all transfers are direct

### 2.3 Alternative Payment

- The Platform may accept other payment methods for services at its discretion
- The availability of $HOPE as a payment method may change at any time
- Service pricing in $HOPE is set by the Platform and may be adjusted without prior notice

## 3. The Platform Does Not Sell or Distribute Tokens

### 3.1 No Token Sales

The ozskr.ai Platform does not:

- Sell $HOPE tokens to users
- Conduct token offerings, presales, or launches
- Set or control the market price of $HOPE tokens
- Operate or manage exchanges or liquidity pools for $HOPE

### 3.2 Third-Party Acquisition

If you acquire $HOPE tokens:

- You do so through third-party decentralized exchanges (e.g., Raydium, Jupiter) or other independent sources
- The Platform is not a party to your acquisition transaction
- The Platform does not receive proceeds from secondary market activity
- You transact directly with smart contracts and liquidity pools on the Solana blockchain

### 3.3 Platform Rewards

The Platform may distribute $HOPE tokens as rewards for participation, achievements, or promotional campaigns. Such distributions:

- Are provided at the Platform's sole discretion
- May be modified or discontinued at any time
- Do not constitute compensation or income
- Are subject to the Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy

---

## 4. No Guarantee of Token Value

### 4.1 Value Determined by Market

The value of $HOPE tokens is determined entirely by third-party market activity. The Platform does not:

- Guarantee any particular value, price, or exchange rate for $HOPE
- Maintain reserves, backing, or collateral for $HOPE tokens
- Commit to buybacks, redemptions, or price support
- Promise that $HOPE will retain any value at any time

### 4.2 Utility May Change

The Platform reserves the right to:

- Modify, expand, or reduce the services accessible with $HOPE
- Adjust service pricing denominated in $HOPE
- Introduce or remove payment methods
- Discontinue $HOPE acceptance with reasonable notice

No change to Platform services or token utility gives rise to any claim for compensation, refund, or damages.

## 5. Volatility Acknowledgment

### 5.1 Price Volatility

By using $HOPE tokens on the Platform, you acknowledge that:

- Digital asset prices are highly volatile and unpredictable
- The value of $HOPE may fluctuate significantly between when you acquire tokens and when you use them for services
- $HOPE tokens may lose all or substantially all of their market value
- Liquidity on secondary markets may be limited or nonexistent
- Market forces entirely outside the Platform's control determine token price

### 5.2 Technical Risks

$HOPE tokens exist on the Solana blockchain and are subject to:

- Smart contract bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits
- Blockchain network failures, congestion, or attacks
- Wallet software bugs or vulnerabilities
- Permanent loss of tokens due to lost private keys
- Irreversibility of blockchain transactions

### 5.3 Regulatory Risks

- The regulatory treatment of digital assets is uncertain and evolving
- Future regulations may restrict or prohibit the use of $HOPE tokens
- Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction and may change
- You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and tax obligations

---

## 6. No Refund Policy

### 6.1 All Token Payments Are Final

Payments made with $HOPE tokens for Platform services are non-refundable. This applies to:

- Content generation credits consumed (whether or not you are satisfied with the output)
- Premium features accessed during a billing period
- Priority processing charges
- Any other service paid for with $HOPE

### 6.2 Rationale

Token payments are processed on-chain and are technically irreversible. Additionally:

- AI generation services consume compute resources at the time of request
- The Platform incurs third-party API costs (Anthropic, fal.ai) at the time of generation
- Service delivery is instantaneous and cannot be "returned"

### 6.3 Exceptions

The Platform may, at its sole discretion, issue service credits (not token refunds) in cases of:

- Verified Platform errors that prevented service delivery (e.g., generation failed due to a server-side bug)
- Duplicate charges caused by a Platform malfunction
- Service outages affecting paid features during an extended period

Service credits are applied to your account for future use and have no cash or token value.

### 6.4 Disputed Transactions

If you believe a token payment was processed in error:

- Contact support@ozskr.ai within 7 days of the transaction
- Include your wallet address and the transaction signature
- The Platform will investigate and respond within 14 business days
- Resolution is at the Platform's sole discretion

---

## 7. Your Responsibilities

By using $HOPE tokens on the Platform, you represent and warrant that:

- You understand that token payments are final and non-refundable
- You accept the volatility and risks associated with holding and using digital assets
- You have obtained your $HOPE tokens through lawful means
- You are legally permitted to hold and transact with digital assets in your jurisdiction
- You are solely responsible for determining and meeting your tax obligations
- You will not use $HOPE tokens in connection with illegal activity

---

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Platform is not liable for:

- Loss of token value before, during, or after use on the Platform
- Inability to use tokens due to network congestion, outages, or technical failures
- Price differences between when you acquired tokens and when you used them
- Third-party exchange failures, delistings, or trading restrictions
- Tax liabilities arising from token transactions
- Any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages related to token usage

---

## 9. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Token Usage Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via:

- Updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this document
- Platform notification for significant changes

Your continued use of $HOPE tokens on the Platform after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
