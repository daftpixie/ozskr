## 5. Repeat Infringer Policy

We maintain a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of users who are repeat infringers of copyright.

### 5.1 Warning System

Our repeat infringer policy operates as follows:

1. **First Offense:**
   - Content is removed from the Platform
   - User receives a written warning via email and Platform notification
   - Notice is recorded in the user's account

2. **Second Offense:**
   - Content is removed from the Platform
   - User account is restricted for 30 days (content generation and social publishing disabled)
   - User receives written notice of restriction

3. **Third Offense:**
   - User account is permanently terminated
   - All associated content is removed from the Platform
   - Wallet address is banned from creating new accounts

### 5.2 Tracking Methodology

Infringement offenses are tracked by:

- Wallet address (primary identifier)
- Associated character identities
- Content generation patterns

We track both valid DMCA takedown notices and instances where users do not file counter-notifications.

### 5.3 Appeals

Users who believe they have been incorrectly identified as repeat infringers may appeal by contacting dmca@ozskr.ai with:

- Wallet address
- Details of each alleged infringement
- Explanation of why the determination was incorrect
- Supporting evidence (e.g., licenses, counter-notifications, court decisions)

## 6. AI-Generated Content and Copyright

The Platform enables users to generate content using AI models (Claude API for text, fal.ai for images). This raises unique copyright considerations.

### 6.1 Platform Responsibility

- The Platform provides tools for AI content generation but does not control what users choose to generate
- Users input prompts and creative direction; the Platform executes the generation
- Content is generated in response to user requests, not initiated by the Platform

### 6.2 User Responsibility

Users are responsible for ensuring that:

- Prompts and inputs do not contain copyrighted material used to reproduce copyrighted works
- Generated content does not infringe third-party copyrights
- Character configurations (names, personas, visual styles) do not infringe trademarks or copyrights
- Content is not designed to impersonate or misrepresent copyrighted characters or brands

### 6.3 Content Moderation Pipeline

The Platform operates an automated content moderation pipeline that:

- Screens generated content for obvious infringement signals (e.g., celebrity names, trademarked terms)
- Flags content that may violate intellectual property rights
- Blocks content that fails moderation checks from being stored or published

However, this pipeline is not foolproof and does not eliminate user responsibility for compliance.

### 6.4 Copyright Status of AI-Generated Content

**Important Notice:**

- AI-generated content may not be eligible for copyright protection in all jurisdictions
- As of the date of this policy, U.S. Copyright Office guidance indicates that content created solely by AI without human authorship is not copyrightable
- Users should consult with intellectual property counsel regarding the copyright status of AI-generated content
- The Platform makes no representations regarding the copyrightability of generated content

### 6.5 Prohibited Uses

Users may NOT use the Platform to:

- Reproduce copyrighted works (e.g., "generate an image of Mickey Mouse")
- Create derivative works without authorization
- Circumvent copyright protections
- Generate content that infringes trademarks, publicity rights, or other intellectual property

Violations may result in content removal and account termination under our repeat infringer policy.

## 7. Content Removal Process

Upon receipt of a valid DMCA takedown notice, we will:

### 7.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Content Removal:** Remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material from:
   - Supabase PostgreSQL database (content marked as removed)
   - Cloudflare R2 object storage (media files deleted or access disabled)
   - Social media platforms (where technically feasible via Ayrshare API — subject to platform policies)

2. **User Notification:** Notify the user who posted the content via:
   - Email to the address associated with their account (if available)
   - In-platform notification visible upon next login

3. **Documentation:** Record the DMCA notice, removal action, and user notification in our compliance records

### 7.2 Timeline for Removal

- **Standard Timeline:** Content will be removed within 24 hours of receipt of a valid DMCA notice
- **Expedited Timeline:** For content involving imminent harm or ongoing distribution, we will prioritize removal and aim for same-business-day processing

### 7.3 Social Media Content

For content already published to third-party social media platforms:

- We will attempt to remove content via Ayrshare API where supported by the destination platform
- Some platforms may not support automated removal; users may need to delete content manually
- Content published before the DMCA notice may persist on social platforms according to their policies
- Users are responsible for responding to DMCA notices on third-party platforms where they have direct accounts

### 7.4 Blockchain Considerations

- The Platform does not publish copyrighted content to the Solana blockchain
- On-chain transactions (token transfers, NFT mints) are immutable and cannot be removed
- Users should not mint NFTs of infringing content; such NFTs cannot be deleted after minting

## 8. Misrepresentation Warning (17 U.S.C. § 512(f))

Under the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that:

1. Material or activity is infringing, or
2. Material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification

may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney's fees.

**Important:**

- Do not submit false or bad-faith DMCA notices
- Do not submit false counter-notifications
- Ensure all statements in your notice or counter-notification are accurate
- Seek legal counsel if you are unsure whether content is infringing

We reserve the right to seek damages from any party that submits a notice or counter-notification in bad faith or with knowledge of material misrepresentation.

---

## 9. Modifications to This Policy

We may update this DMCA Policy from time to time to reflect changes in:

- Applicable law and legal requirements
- Platform features and content types
- Industry best practices
- Content removal processes

We will notify you of material changes by:

- Posting a notice on the Platform
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Sending a notification via the Platform interface (for significant changes)

Changes become effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Platform after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
