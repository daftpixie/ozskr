# DRAFT — REQUIRES ATTORNEY REVIEW — NOT LEGAL ADVICE

# ozskr.ai AI Content Disclosure Policy

**Effective Date:** [DATE — TO BE SET]

**Last Updated:** February 13, 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

This policy describes how ozskr.ai identifies, labels, and attributes AI-generated content. All content produced through the Platform is generated by artificial intelligence and must be treated accordingly by users when sharing, publishing, or repurposing it.

---

## 2. What Counts as AI-Generated Content

Everything produced through the Platform's generation pipeline is AI-generated, including:

- **Text content** created via Anthropic's Claude API
- **Image content** created via fal.ai models
- **Social media posts** composed by AI based on user-defined character parameters
- **Scheduled content** produced automatically by background generation jobs

Users define the character personas and prompts, but the output is authored by AI models. There is no human authorship in the generation step.

---

## 3. Platform-Level Labeling

### 3.1 In-App Labels

Within the ozskr.ai interface:

- All generated content displays an "AI-Generated" label
- Content cards show the generating AI model name (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4-5")
- Character profiles are marked as "AI Agent"
- Generation history includes timestamps, model identifiers, and moderation status

### 3.2 Published Content

When content is published to social media via the Platform:

- The Platform provides suggested disclosure language (e.g., "Generated by AI", "#AIGenerated")
- Publishing templates include AI disclosure hashtags by default
- A warning is displayed when publishing without disclosure elements
- Links to destination platform AI content policies are provided

---

## 4. The `generated_by` Metadata Field

### 4.1 Attribution Schema

Every piece of content stored by the Platform includes structured metadata:

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `generated_by` | AI model identifier | `"claude-sonnet-4-5"`, `"fal-ai/flux-pro"` |
| `generation_timestamp` | When content was created | `"2026-02-13T15:30:00Z"` |
| `character_id` | Which AI character generated it | `"char_abc123"` |
| `platform` | Source platform | `"ozskr.ai"` |
| `ai_generated` | Boolean flag | `true` |
| `content_type` | Type of content | `"text"`, `"image"` |

### 4.2 Where Metadata Lives

- **Database:** The `content_generations` table in Supabase stores `generated_by` as an immutable field set at creation time
- **API responses:** All content endpoints return the `ai_generated: true` flag and full attribution metadata
- **Exported files:** Downloaded content includes metadata in supported formats (EXIF for images, JSON sidecar for text)

### 4.3 Metadata Integrity

- The `generated_by` field is set server-side during the generation pipeline and cannot be modified by users
- Attribution metadata is preserved through the full content lifecycle: generation, moderation, storage, and publishing
- Users must not remove or alter attribution metadata when exporting or republishing content

## 5. User Responsibilities When Reposting

### 5.1 Disclosure Obligation

When you publish, share, repost, or redistribute AI-generated content from ozskr.ai, you are responsible for:

- Disclosing that the content was generated by AI
- Complying with the AI content policies of the destination platform
- Following FTC guidelines on endorsements and transparency
- Not misleading audiences about the nature or origin of the content

### 5.2 Recommended Disclosure Language

We recommend including one or more of the following when sharing AI-generated content:

- **Clear statement:** "This content was generated by AI."
- **Hashtags:** `#AIGenerated`, `#AIContent`, `#CreatedWithAI`
- **Attribution:** "Created with ozskr.ai" (optional)

### 5.3 Destination Platform Requirements

Users must comply with AI disclosure rules on each platform they publish to:

| Platform | Requirement |
|----------|------------|
| **Twitter/X** | AI-generated media labeling recommended; misleading AI content prohibited |
| **Instagram/Meta** | AI-generated realistic images of people must be labeled |
| **TikTok** | AI-generated or manipulated content must be disclosed |

Platform policies change frequently. It is your responsibility to stay current.

### 5.4 Prohibited Practices

### 6.1 Character Naming

- AI agents must not use the real names of public figures without clear parody or fan-account labeling

### 6.2 Professional Advice Prohibition

AI agents must not be configured to provide:
