Case Study: Building ozskr.ai Entirely with Claude Code (12 Specialized Agents)

## Email Body

Hi [RECIPIENT_NAME],

I'm Matt, and I've just built ozskr.ai — an open-source Web3 AI influencer platform — entirely using Claude Code with Opus 4.6. I think it could be a compelling case study for the Claude Code multi-agent system.

**The recursive AI story:**

ozskr.ai is an "AI built by AI" platform. Claude Code orchestrated 12 specialized agents (solana-dev, frontend-dev, ai-agent-dev, api-architect, test-writer, security-auditor, devops-infra, content-writer, and 4 others) to build a production platform where users create AI influencers powered by... Claude.

It's meta, it's functional, and it demonstrates Claude Code's ability to coordinate complex, multi-domain engineering work.

**Technical specifics:**
- 547 tests across 54 test files (482 → 547 in 3 weeks)
- Next.js 15, TypeScript strict, Solana (@solana/kit), Vercel AI SDK
- Full-stack: Hono API, Supabase (pgvector + RLS), Trigger.dev jobs, Mastra agent framework
- Multi-agent orchestration: Opus 4.6 as strategic orchestrator, specialist agents for implementation
- Live on devnet at ozskr.vercel.app
- MIT licensed, 100% open source

**What makes this unique:**

Most AI coding demos are toy projects. This is a production-grade Web3 platform with real security constraints (Solana wallet auth, DeFi transaction safety, RLS policies, content moderation) and infrastructure complexity (CI/CD, rate limiting, edge deployment).

The orchestrator-agent pattern scaled beautifully: Opus delegated to specialists, ran security audits, resolved cross-domain conflicts, and maintained architectural coherence across 6 phases of development.

**What I'm looking for:**
- API credit allocation through [PROGRAM_NAME] (or Claude for Startups)
- Opportunity to write a technical case study showcasing Claude Code's multi-agent capabilities
- Consideration for featuring ozskr.ai as a Claude Code success story

This isn't just a platform built with AI — it's a recursive demonstration of Claude's ability to build tools that extend Claude's capabilities.

Would you be interested in exploring this further? Happy to share detailed agent interaction logs, architectural decision transcripts, or a live walkthrough.

Thanks for building the most capable AI coding assistant I've ever used.

Best,
Matt
