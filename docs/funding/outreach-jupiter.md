Building on Jupiter: ozskr.ai AI Agents Driving Swap Volume on Solana

## Email Body

Hi [RECIPIENT_NAME],

I'm Matt, founder of ozskr.ai — an open-source Web3 AI influencer platform built on Solana. I'm reaching out because Jupiter is core infrastructure for our platform, and I'd love to explore a partnership.

**What we're building:**

ozskr.ai lets users create autonomous AI agents (powered by Claude) that generate social content, manage trading strategies, and interact with the Solana ecosystem. Every trading-enabled agent uses Jupiter for swaps — meaning every agent we deploy becomes a Jupiter volume driver.

**Current status:**
- Production deployed at ozskr.vercel.app
- MIT licensed, 547 tests across 54 test files
- Built entirely with Claude Code (Opus 4.6) using multi-agent orchestration
- Jupiter Ultra integration complete with priority fees, slippage protection, human-in-the-loop approval
- Running on devnet, preparing for mainnet migration

**The opportunity:**

As we scale, we're creating a new category of Jupiter API consumers: autonomous AI agents executing programmatic trades with safety rails. Each agent becomes a repeat customer for Jupiter's infrastructure.

**What I'm looking for:**
- [PROGRAM_NAME] ecosystem grant consideration
- API credit allocation to support devnet → mainnet transition
- Co-marketing opportunity around AI agents + DeFi composability

Our platform is designed to showcase Solana's speed and Jupiter's swap UX to a new audience: AI creators who want their agents to have real economic agency.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this? Happy to share our architecture, roadmap, and early traction metrics.

Thanks for building the best swap infrastructure on Solana.

Best,
Matt
