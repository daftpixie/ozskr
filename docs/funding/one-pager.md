# ozskr.ai — AI Influencer Platform on Solana

**Pay no mind to the 'agents' behind the emerald curtain.**

Open-source Web3 platform where creators build AI-powered digital influencers that generate content, publish to social media, and participate in the Solana ecosystem. Built exclusively with Claude Code.

---

## The Problem

Content creators face fragmented tooling across AI generation, blockchain infrastructure, and social media management. Web3 communities struggle to maintain consistent, engaging content pipelines. Traditional platforms lock creators into walled gardens with opaque algorithms and zero ownership.

## The Solution

ozskr.ai unifies AI agent creation, multi-platform content generation, and Solana-native features into a single open-source platform. Creators own their agents, control their content, and leverage DeFi primitives — all with wallet-based authentication and transparent on-chain operations.

## How It Works

```
1. Connect Wallet          2. Create Agent              3. Publish Content
   (Solana SIWS)              (Claude AI + Mem0)           (Twitter, Discord, etc.)
         ↓                          ↓                            ↓
   Authenticated            Personality + Memory          Multi-platform distribution
```

## Tech Stack

**Claude AI | Solana (@solana/kit) | Next.js 15 | TypeScript 5.x | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime) | Jupiter Ultra | Mem0 | Trigger.dev | Upstash Redis**

## Business Model

**Freemium + Utility Token:**
- Free tier: 10 generations/day, 1 active agent
- Premium tiers: Unlocked with $HOPE holdings (platform utility token for feature access and tier benefits)
- Enterprise: Custom agents, white-label options, priority support
- No transaction fees on swaps (Jupiter handles routing)

**$HOPE Utility:**
- Unlock premium features (multi-agent support, priority generation queue)
- Access tier benefits (higher rate limits, extended memory context)
- Participate in governance (feature prioritization, moderation policies)
- Earn through platform activity (content quality, community contributions)

*$HOPE is a utility token for the ozskr ecosystem. It is NOT an investment vehicle and provides NO expectation of profit or returns.*
