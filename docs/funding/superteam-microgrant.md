# Superteam Microgrant Application: ozskr.ai

**Project:** ozskr.ai — AI Influencer Platform on Solana

**Category:** Consumer Applications / DeFi
**Website:** https://ozskr.vercel.app
**GitHub:** https://github.com/daftpixie/ozskr (MIT License)

## What are you building?

ozskr.ai lets creators build AI-powered digital influencers that generate content, publish to social media, and trade tokens on Solana. Think "AI agent platform meets DeFi meets content creation" — all non-custodial, all open source. Built entirely with Claude Code in 6 weeks.

## Why does this matter for Solana?

**Ecosystem Growth**
- Onboards creators who aren't crypto-native (first Solana wallet for many)
- Drives Jupiter Ultra swap volume through AI agent trading features
- Creates utility demand for $HOPE platform token (tier unlocks, feature access)

**Technical Showcase**
- Demonstrates @solana/kit functional patterns vs deprecated web3.js v1
- Real-world proof of sub-second finality for content publishing workflows
- $0.00025 tx fees enable micro-transactions that aren't viable on other chains

**Developer Education**
- MIT licensed codebase — all patterns open for builders to study
- AI-assisted development story: "zero to production in 6 weeks"
- Reusable components (SIWS auth, Jupiter hooks, Hono middleware)

## What have you built so far?

**Production Stats:**
- 587 tests across 58 test files (100% passing)
- Live on devnet at ozskr.vercel.app
- 12 AI agents in orchestrated development workflow
- Full CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Dependabot, security scanning)
- 10 legal policy documents drafted (Privacy, ToS, AI Disclosure, Token Terms, etc.)

**Core Features Shipping:**
- 7-stage AI content pipeline (Claude + Mem0 memory + fal.ai images)
- SocialPublisher abstraction (Twitter Direct API + Ayrshare multi-platform)
- Jupiter Ultra integration (swaps, slippage protection, priority fees)
- Wallet auth via SIWS (Sign-In with Solana)
- Gamification layer (achievements, leaderboard, streak tracking)

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 15, TypeScript 5.x strict, Tailwind CSS
- API: Hono, Zod validation, Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- AI: Claude 4.6, Mem0, Mastra agents, Langfuse tracing
- Solana: @solana/kit, Jupiter Ultra, wallet-adapter-react
- Deploy: Vercel (production), Trigger.dev (background jobs), Upstash (rate limiting)

## What will the grant fund?

**Alpha/Beta Infrastructure (3 months): $4,500**
- Vercel Pro, Supabase Pro, Helius RPC, Trigger.dev Cloud, Upstash Redis
- Estimated: $1,500/mo at 100 active users
- Buffer for scaling spikes during Product Hunt launch

**AI Inference Costs (3 months): $2,500**
- Claude API ($0.015/1K tokens), Mem0 Cloud, fal.ai, OpenAI Moderation
- Estimated: ~$800/mo at 100 users generating 30K content pieces
- Buffer for user growth

**KOL Outreach & Community Building: $2,000**
- Partner with 5-10 crypto influencers to test alpha, provide feedback
- Discord/Zealy quest rewards (community onboarding incentives)
- Content creation (build-in-public threads, video tutorials)

**Security & Legal: $1,000**
- API penetration testing (pre-mainnet)
- Attorney review of token disclaimer (SEC-safe framing)
- Vulnerability disclosure program launch

## Timeline and milestones

**Month 1: Alpha (50 users)**
- Invite-only waitlist launch (500-spot cap already built)
- Mainnet migration (RPC config, token deployment)
- KOL feedback loop (3-5 partners testing platform)
- **Metric:** 50 wallets connected, 5,000+ content pieces generated

**Month 2: Closed Beta (200 users)**
- Feature flag rollout (gradual unlock for stability)
- Twitter Direct API rate limit testing (1,500 posts/day limit)
- First $HOPE tier upgrades (test utility token mechanics)
- **Metric:** 200 wallets, $5,000+ Jupiter swap volume

**Month 3: Open Beta + Launch (500+ users)**
- Product Hunt listing
- Public GitHub repo (add 20 Topics for discoverability)
- Build-in-public thread series (20+ tweets prepared)
- SDK alpha release (TypeScript library for third-party devs)
- **Metric:** 500+ wallets, $25,000+ swap volume, 50K+ content pieces

## Team

**Solo Founder: Matt**
- 10+ years software engineering (AI/ML, Web3, full-stack TypeScript)
- Built entire platform with Claude Code AI (Opus 4.6 orchestrator + 12 specialist agents)
- Solana development since 2022 (hackathons, open-source contributions)

**Development Approach:**
Platform is "AI built by AI" — all code AI-generated, human-reviewed. This isn't a gimmick — it's a case study in AI-assisted development velocity. 6 weeks from zero to 587 tests, production deployment, legal compliance.

**Commitment:**
- Full-time on ozskr.ai for 6+ months
- Bi-weekly progress reports (public GitHub discussions)
- Open-source contributions beyond ozskr.ai (Solana ecosystem libraries)

## Why This Grant Matters

ozskr.ai is break-even at 3 users, 92%+ margins at 1K users (see full revenue model in repo). We're not building a VC-dependent burn machine — we're building a sustainable platform that happens to need runway for alpha/beta infrastructure before revenue kicks in.

The grant buys us 3 months to:
1. Prove product-market fit with creators
2. Demonstrate Solana's technical advantages (speed, cost) to non-crypto-native users
3. Open-source reusable patterns for the builder community

After 3 months, platform fees (5% of Jupiter swaps) + premium tiers ($HOPE token gating) cover ongoing costs. We're building for longevity, not a quick exit.

**$HOPE Token Disclaimer:**
$HOPE is a utility token for the ozskr.ai platform, enabling feature access and tier benefits. It is NOT an investment vehicle and provides NO expectation of profit or returns. All mentions of $HOPE in this application refer strictly to its utility function within the platform ecosystem.
