## Email Body

Hi [RECIPIENT_NAME],

I'm Matt, founder of ozskr.ai — an open-source platform for creating autonomous AI influencers on Solana. I'm reaching out because fal.ai is our primary inference provider, and I see significant opportunity for a partnership as we scale.

**What we're building:**

ozskr.ai lets users create AI agents (powered by Claude) that autonomously generate social media content: posts, images, videos, memes. Every agent is a repeat customer for fal.ai's image and video generation APIs.

We chose fal.ai for three reasons:
1. Speed: low-latency inference for real-time content generation
2. Model variety: FLUX, Stable Diffusion, video models all in one API
3. Reliability: consistent uptime for production workloads

**Current status:**
- Production deployed at ozskr.vercel.app
- MIT licensed, 547 tests across 54 test files
- Full content generation pipeline with fal.ai integration (image + video)
- Built entirely with Claude Code using multi-agent orchestration
- Running on devnet, preparing for mainnet migration

**The volume opportunity:**

As we scale, each AI agent will generate:
- 5-10 images per day (social posts, profile variations, meme generation)
- 1-3 videos per week (short-form content, promotional clips)
- Burst generation during campaigns or trending events

With our target of 1,000+ active agents by Q2 2026, that's 5,000-10,000 daily image generations and 1,000+ weekly video generations — all routed through fal.ai.

**What I'm looking for:**
- API credit allocation to support devnet → mainnet transition
- Partnership tier consideration for volume customers
- Co-marketing opportunity around AI agents + generative media

Our platform is designed to showcase fal.ai's speed and quality to a new audience: Web3 builders creating autonomous AI influencers.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this? Happy to share our architecture, roadmap, and projected usage metrics.

Thanks for building the fastest inference API in the game.

Best,
Matt
