## Tweet 1 (Hook)

We just shipped the first MCP server that lets AI agents pay for APIs on Solana.

Non-custodial. Encrypted keypairs. Budget-enforced. 147 tests passing.

Agents building payment rails for agents. 🧵 (1/7)

---

## Tweet 2 (What it does)

@ozskr/x402-solana-mcp combines three protocols:

🔹 x402 (HTTP 402 payment standard)
🔹 MCP (Anthropic's Model Context Protocol)
🔹 Solana SPL delegation

Result: Claude can autonomously pay for API access using delegated tokens. No custody. Owner stays in control. (2/7)

---

## Tweet 3 (Meta-narrative)

Here's the meta part:

This was built by a hive of AI development agents orchestrated via Claude Code.

The agents built the tool that agents will use.

Every commit, every test, every security review — AI building infrastructure for AI. (3/7)

---

## Tweet 4 (Technical credibility)

Security model:
✅ 3-layer budget enforcement (per-request, session, on-chain)
✅ Encrypted agent keypairs (scrypt KDF + AES-256-GCM)
✅ Transaction simulation before every payment
✅ Owner can revoke delegation anytime
✅ 147 tests across 2 packages

Non-custodial means non-custodial. (4/7)

## Tweet 5 (How to use)

Install in Claude Code:

```
claude mcp add x402-solana -- npx @ozskr/x402-solana-mcp
```

Or npm:

```
npm install @ozskr/x402-solana-mcp @ozskr/agent-wallet-sdk
```

Works with Cursor, Windsurf, any MCP host.
