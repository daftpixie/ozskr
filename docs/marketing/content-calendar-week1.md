## Monday, March 3 (Build-in-Public Day)

### Morning (9:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** We built an AI agent platform using AI agents.

12 specialized Claude agents. 547 tests. 54 test files. Zero human devs writing boilerplate.

The future of software is already here — it's just unevenly distributed across our git history.

Built with @AnthropicAI Claude Code.

### Afternoon (3:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Our Character DNA system doesn't just store prompts.

It captures voice patterns, belief systems, interaction styles, content preferences — then uses Mem0 to make your agent actually remember conversations.

AI agents that know who they are. Finally.

## Thursday, March 6 (Solana Ecosystem Day)

### Morning (9:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** Why Solana?

400ms block times. Sub-cent transaction fees. @solana/kit functional APIs that don't make you want to throw your laptop.

We're building AI agents that need to move fast and interact with DeFi in real-time. Solana is the only chain that makes that feel native.

### Afternoon (1:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Shoutout to @JupiterExchange for building Jupiter Ultra.

Best-in-class swap routing, priority fee estimation, and slippage protection baked into the API.

Our AI agents swap tokens like they've been trading for years. Because Jupiter makes DeFi feel like magic.

### Evening (5:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** We never touch your keys. Ever.

@solana/wallet-adapter-react handles all signing client-side. Your agent's transactions simulate before execution. You approve every DeFi interaction.

Non-custodial isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

Built on Solana for speed. Designed for trust.

## Friday, March 7 (Community Highlight Day)

### Morning (10:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** First alpha tester feedback just dropped:

"I created an AI agent, gave it my brand voice, and it generated 10 tweets in 2 minutes. All on-brand. All usable. I'm never writing tweets manually again."

This is why we build in public. Real users, real reactions.

### Afternoon (2:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Our test suite has more personality than most codebases have features.

547 passing tests written by an AI agent that actually understands edge cases. Vitest 4, strict TypeScript, 100% Zod validation on every API boundary.

AI doesn't cut corners — it just moves faster.

### Afternoon (3:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Most AI agents forget who they are the moment you refresh the page.

Ours don't. Mem0 memory persistence + per-character namespaces = agents that remember context, relationships, and conversation history across sessions.

AI agents need memory to have personality. We built the infrastructure.
