## Build-in-Public (5 tweets)

### Tweet 1: The Meta Moment
We built an AI agent platform using AI agents.

12 specialized Claude agents. 482 tests. 48 test files. Zero human devs writing boilerplate.

The future of software is already here — it's just unevenly distributed across our git history.

Built with @AnthropicAI Claude Code.

### Tweet 2: Test Coverage Flex
Our test suite has more personality than most codebases have features.

482 passing tests written by an AI agent that actually understands edge cases. Vitest 4, strict TypeScript, 100% Zod validation on every API boundary.

AI doesn't cut corners — it just moves faster.

### Tweet 3: Agent Orchestration Deep-Dive
How do you build software when your "team" is 12 AI agents?

Opus 4.6 orchestrates. Specialists execute. security-auditor gates every Solana integration. code-reviewer runs on everything.

We're not replacing developers. We're showing what's possible when AI builds AI.

### Tweet 4: Real Commit Message
Actual commit message from today:

"feat: add content moderation pipeline with 7-stage validation"

Written by ai-agent-dev. Reviewed by security-auditor. Merged by the orchestrator.

The pull request had better docs than most startups' entire codebases.

This is build-in-public taken literally.

### Tweet 5: Technical Transparency
Our stack: Next.js 15, @solana/kit, Claude API, Mem0, fal.ai, Jupiter Ultra, Supabase, Trigger.dev.

482+ tests. MIT licensed. Open source.

Every integration decision made by AI agents debating architectural trade-offs in git worktrees.

The future is transparent. And it ships faster than you think.

## Product Features (5 tweets)

### Tweet 6: Core Value Prop
Create an AI agent. Give it a personality. Watch it generate content, build an audience, and navigate Solana DeFi.

Your AI influencer, your rules. Non-custodial. Open source. Built on Solana.

Welcome to ozskr.ai — where AI agents become digital influencers.

### Tweet 7: Character DNA System
Our Character DNA system doesn't just store prompts.

It captures voice patterns, belief systems, interaction styles, content preferences — then uses Mem0 to make your agent actually remember conversations across sessions.

AI agents that know who they are. Finally.

### Tweet 8: Content Pipeline
7-stage content generation pipeline:

Parse → Context → Enhance → Generate → Quality Check → Moderation → Store

Every piece of AI-generated content runs the gauntlet before it hits your audience.

Quality isn't optional. It's architectural.

### Tweet 9: Jupiter Integration
Your AI agent can swap tokens via Jupiter Ultra without you touching the keyboard.

Slippage guards. Transaction simulation. Human-in-the-loop approval for every DeFi action.

We built the guardrails so your agent can explore Solana DeFi safely.

### Tweet 10: Social Publishing
Connect Twitter. Set your agent's voice. Hit generate.

Your AI agent handles content creation, scheduling, and publishing while you focus on strategy.

SocialPublisher abstraction supports multiple platforms — Twitter direct posting via OAuth PKCE, more integrations coming.

Ship content at AI speed.

## Solana Ecosystem (5 tweets)

### Tweet 11: Why Solana
Why Solana?

400ms block times. Sub-cent transaction fees. @solana/kit functional APIs that don't make you want to throw your laptop.

We're building AI agents that need to move fast and interact with DeFi in real-time. Solana is the only chain that makes that feel native.

### Tweet 12: Non-Custodial Architecture
We never touch your keys. Ever.

@solana/wallet-adapter-react handles all signing client-side. Your agent's transactions simulate before execution. You approve every DeFi interaction.

Non-custodial isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

Built on Solana for speed. Designed for trust.

### Tweet 13: Jupiter Love
Shoutout to @JupiterExchange for building Jupiter Ultra.

Best-in-class swap routing, priority fee estimation, and slippage protection baked into the API.

Our AI agents swap tokens like they've been trading for years. Because Jupiter makes DeFi feel like magic.

### Tweet 14: Helius RPC
Fast RPC matters when your AI agent is generating content, checking wallet balances, and simulating swaps in parallel.

@heliuslabs RPC keeps our agents moving at the speed of thought.

Solana's performance is only as good as your RPC provider. We chose well.

### Tweet 15: Wallet Interop
Any Solana wallet. One platform.

Phantom, Solflare, Backpack — if it works with wallet-adapter, it works with ozskr.ai.

Your AI agent inherits your wallet's identity without us ever seeing your seed phrase.

That's how Solana interoperability is supposed to feel.

## AI/Tech Thought Leadership (5 tweets)

### Tweet 16: Memory That Matters
Most AI agents forget who they are the moment you refresh the page.

Ours don't. Mem0 memory persistence + per-character namespaces = agents that remember context, relationships, and conversation history across sessions.

AI agents need memory to have personality. We built the infrastructure.

### Tweet 17: Prompt Injection Defenses
Every user input runs through Zod validation + content moderation before it touches Claude API.

Prompt injection attempts get flagged and rejected at the pipeline layer — not after your agent says something embarrassing.

Security isn't a feature. It's stage 6 of 7 in our content pipeline.

### Tweet 18: Claude Prompt Caching
We use Claude's prompt caching to keep Character DNA context warm across generations.

Result: 90% cost reduction on repeated content generation for the same agent. Sub-500ms response times even with 8K+ token character profiles.

AI at scale requires smart caching. We learned that early.

### Tweet 19: Multi-Agent Orchestration
Opus 4.6 doesn't write code. It orchestrates 11 specialist agents who do.

solana-dev handles DeFi. frontend-dev ships UI. security-auditor gates everything.

The future of software isn't solo AI devs. It's AI teams with specialized expertise coordinated by an orchestrator.

### Tweet 20: AI-Generated Content Disclosure
Every piece of AI-generated content on ozskr.ai is labeled as such.

We're building AI agents that create content at scale. Transparency isn't optional — it's how we earn trust in a world where "real" and "generated" are getting harder to distinguish.

## Community/Hype (5 tweets)

### Tweet 21: Waitlist Launch
The waitlist is live.

500 spots for alpha access. First come, first served.

Create AI agents. Generate content. Publish to Twitter. Swap on Jupiter. All from one dashboard.

We're not in Kansas anymore.

https://ozskr.vercel.app

### Tweet 22: Alpha Testing Preview
Alpha testers will get:

### Tweet 23: Spot Count Update
327 of 500 waitlist spots claimed.

If you're curious about AI agents that actually ship content, generate images with fal.ai, and navigate Solana DeFi — now's the time.

Alpha access unlocks March 2026.

The yellow brick road has a capacity limit.

### Tweet 24: Open Source Announcement
ozskr.ai is open source. MIT licensed.

Every AI agent prompt, every pipeline stage, every security gate — it's all on GitHub.

We're building the future of AI agents in public because the best products are built with community input, not behind closed doors.

Star the repo. Ship a PR. Join the journey.

### Tweet 25: Launch Week Tease
Launch week is coming.

Day 1: Product Hunt launch
Day 2: Architecture deep-dive blog post
Day 3: "How AI Built an AI Platform" case study
Day 4: First 50 alpha invites go out
Day 5: Live AMA with the orchestrator (yes, seriously)

Follow the emerald lights. This is just the beginning.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Scheduling**: Space tweets 2-4 hours apart during peak engagement windows (9am-12pm PT, 4pm-7pm PT)
- **Hashtags**: Use sparingly — #Solana, #AI, #BuildInPublic only when contextually relevant
- **Mentions**: Tag partners (@AnthropicAI, @JupiterExchange, @heliuslabs) when relevant, max once per tweet
- **Thread potential**: Tweets 3, 7, 16, 19 can expand into full threads
- **Engagement hooks**: Tweets ending with questions or calls-to-action (21, 22, 24, 25) should be prioritized for high-traffic times
