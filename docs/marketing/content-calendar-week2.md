# Content Calendar — Week 2

**Dates:** March 10-16, 2026
**Platform:** Twitter/X
**Strategy:** Sustain momentum with technical deep-dives and early user showcases
**Content Mix:** 40% build-in-public, 30% features, 20% Solana ecosystem, 10% engagement

## Monday, March 10 (Build-in-Public Day)

### Morning (9:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** How do you build software when your "team" is 12 AI agents?

Opus 4.6 orchestrates. Specialists execute. security-auditor gates every Solana integration. code-reviewer runs on everything.

We're not replacing developers. We're showing what's possible when AI builds AI.

### Afternoon (2:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** 7-stage content generation pipeline:

Parse → Context → Enhance → Generate → Quality Check → Moderation → Store

Every piece of AI-generated content runs the gauntlet before it hits your audience.

Quality isn't optional. It's architectural.

### Evening (6:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Actual commit message from last week:

"feat: add content moderation pipeline with 7-stage validation"

Written by ai-agent-dev. Reviewed by security-auditor. Merged by the orchestrator.

The pull request had better docs than most startups' entire codebases.

This is build-in-public taken literally.

## Tuesday, March 11 (Product Feature Spotlight)

### Morning (9:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** Connect Twitter. Set your agent's voice. Hit generate.

Your AI agent handles content creation, scheduling, and publishing while you focus on strategy.

SocialPublisher abstraction supports multiple platforms — Twitter direct via OAuth PKCE, more integrations coming.

Ship content at AI speed.

### Midday (1:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Every user input runs through Zod validation + content moderation before it touches Claude API.

Prompt injection attempts get flagged and rejected at the pipeline layer — not after your agent says something embarrassing.

Security isn't a feature. It's stage 6 of 7 in our content pipeline.

### Evening (5:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** We use Claude's prompt caching to keep Character DNA context warm across generations.

Result: 90% cost reduction on repeated content generation for the same agent. Sub-500ms response times even with 8K+ token character profiles.

AI at scale requires smart caching. We learned that early.

## Wednesday, March 12 (Thread Drop Day — Architecture)

### Morning (10:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** Thread incoming: The architecture behind a production Solana AI agent platform.

Next.js 15. TypeScript strict. Non-custodial DeFi. AI memory with pgvector.

No fluff. No wrappers. Just patterns that work. 🧵

**Media:** See thread-2 for tweet-by-tweet media

### Afternoon (3:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** First user-generated content showcase:

@AlphaUser1 created an AI agent named "Emerald" that generated 50 tweets in her brand voice, scheduled 2 weeks of content, and gained 300+ followers in 72 hours.

No manual writing. All AI. All on-brand.

This is what we built for.

## Thursday, March 13 (Solana Ecosystem Day)

### Morning (9:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** Fast RPC matters when your AI agent is generating content, checking wallet balances, and simulating swaps in parallel.

@heliuslabs RPC keeps our agents moving at the speed of thought.

Solana's performance is only as good as your RPC provider. We chose well.

### Afternoon (1:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Any Solana wallet. One platform.

Phantom, Solflare, Backpack — if it works with wallet-adapter, it works with ozskr.ai.

Your AI agent inherits your wallet's identity without us ever seeing your seed phrase.

That's how Solana interoperability is supposed to feel.

### Evening (5:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Building on Solana means:

400ms finality (vs. Ethereum's 12 minutes)
$0.0001 tx fees (vs. Ethereum's $5-50)
@solana/kit functional APIs (vs. web3.js class hell)

We chose Solana because our AI agents need to move at the speed of AI, not the speed of legacy blockchains.

## Friday, March 14 (Community Highlight Day)

### Morning (10:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** Alpha tester spotlight:

@BetaBuilder shipped 10 AI agents in 3 days. Each with unique personalities, content styles, and Solana wallets.

"I thought this would take months. I had a full agent army in less time than my last API integration."

Real builders, real velocity.

### Afternoon (2:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Our stack: Next.js 15, @solana/kit, Claude API, Mem0, fal.ai, Jupiter Ultra, Supabase, Trigger.dev.

547+ tests. MIT licensed. Open source.

Every integration decision made by AI agents debating architectural trade-offs in git worktrees.

The future is transparent. And it ships faster than you think.

### Evening (7:00 PM EST — Friday Vibes)
**Tweet:** Weekend plans:

[ ] Touch grass
[ ] Manually write tweets
[X] Watch my AI agent generate content while I play Elden Ring

The future is here and it's gloriously lazy.

## Saturday, March 15 (Blog Post Day — Architecture)

### Morning (11:00 AM EST)
**Tweet:** New blog post: "Building a Production Solana AI Platform: Architecture Deep Dive"

The full technical breakdown. Why Supabase over "separate everything." How we saved $86K/year on social APIs. Real cost projections.

No fluff. Just patterns that scale.

### Afternoon (3:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Opus 4.6 doesn't write code. It orchestrates 11 specialist agents who do.

solana-dev handles DeFi. frontend-dev ships UI. security-auditor gates everything.

The future of software isn't solo AI devs. It's AI teams with specialized expertise coordinated by an orchestrator.

### Evening (7:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Cost math that matters:

100 active users × 10 posts/day = 1,000 posts
Claude API (with caching): $90/mo
fal.ai images: $50/mo
Infrastructure: $171.50/mo

Total: $311.50/mo = $3.11/user/mo

85% gross margin at $19.99/mo pricing.

Unit economics from day 1.

### Afternoon (2:00 PM EST)
**Tweet:** Every piece of AI-generated content on ozskr.ai is labeled as such.

We're building AI agents that create content at scale. Transparency isn't optional — it's how we earn trust in a world where "real" and "generated" are getting harder to distinguish.

### Evening (6:00 PM EST)

Alpha access unlocks March 20.

If you're curious about AI agents that actually ship content, generate images with fal.ai, and navigate Solana DeFi — now's the time.

The yellow brick road has a capacity limit.
