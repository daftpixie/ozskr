## Build-in-Public (5 tweets)

### BIP-1: Test Coverage Flex
```
482 tests passing. Zero any types. TypeScript strict mode.

Pay no mind to the agents behind the emerald curtain — they're just obsessed with type safety.

### BIP-2: Milestone — 7-Stage Pipeline
```
Shipped: 7-stage AI content pipeline.
Parse → Context → Enhance → Generate → Quality → Moderation → Store

Every piece of content goes through the gauntlet. No shortcuts.

#AI #ContentGeneration #BuildInPublic
```

---

### BIP-3: Non-Custodial Win
```
Just shipped Sign-In with Solana (SIWS) auth.

Platform never touches your keys. Never holds your funds. Non-custodial is the only way.

ozskr.ai doesn't want your seed phrase. #Solana #Web3Security
```

---

### BIP-4: Open Source Launch
```
We're open source. MIT license. Built entirely with Claude Code (Opus 4.6).

github.com/daftpixie/ozskr

AI agents building AI agent infrastructure. It's turtles all the way down.

#OpenSource #AI #Solana
```

---

### BIP-5: Mem0 Memory Integration
```
Shipped persistent agent memory via Mem0.

Your AI agent remembers context across sessions. Not just GPT-4 with a Twitter account — actual stateful intelligence.

#AI #MachineLearning #BuildInPublic
```

## Feature Highlights (5 tweets)

### FH-1: Jupiter Ultra Trading
```
ozskr agents trade on Jupiter Ultra with priority fees, slippage guards, and tx simulation before every swap.

Human-in-the-loop approval required. No YOLO trades.

#Solana #DeFi #JupiterExchange
```
**Media**: Trading interface screenshot

---

### FH-2: Multi-Platform Publishing
```
One agent. Multiple platforms.

Twitter API direct + Ayrshare for everything else. Rate limiting per wallet. Content moderation pipeline before publish.

AI influencers that respect the TOS. #SocialMedia #AI
```

---

### FH-3: 7-Stage Content Pipeline
```
How we generate content:
1. Parse input
2. Load context (Mem0)
3. Enhance with personality
4. Generate via Claude
5. Quality check
6. Moderation filter
7. Store + publish

No raw LLM outputs. Ever. #AI #ContentStrategy
```

---

### FH-4: Gamification System
```
Points. Achievements. Streaks. Leaderboards.

$HOPE rewards unlock tier benefits. Not a financial instrument — just platform utility for the grinders.

Pay no mind to the XP bar. #Gamification #Web3
```

---

### FH-5: Security-First Architecture
```
What we never do:
- Sign transactions for you
- Hold your crypto
- Store private keys

What we do:
- Simulate every tx
- Rate limit per wallet
- RLS on every DB query

#Security #Web3 #NonCustodial

## Alpha Drops / Teasers (5 tweets)

### AD-1: Waitlist Open
```
Alpha access is gated. Waitlist is open.

ozskr.vercel.app

### AD-2: Coming Soon — Agent Marketplace
```
Coming soon: Agent DNA marketplace.

Mint. Trade. Clone. Your agent's personality becomes an on-chain asset.

This is not financial advice. This is weird future stuff. #NFT #Solana
```

---

### AD-3: Stealth Mode Off
```
Been building in the shadows for 6 months. 45 files. 482 tests. Zero compromises on security.

Alpha drops soon. Follow the yellow brick road.

```

---

### AD-4: Agent Showcase Incoming
```
First 10 agents go live next week.

Each one has persistent memory, real trading permissions, and a personality you can actually talk to.

Not bots. Agents. Big difference. #AI #Solana
```

---

### AD-5: Beta Invites
```
Beta invites drop Thursday. Check your DMs if you're on the waitlist.

Only requirement: have a Solana wallet. That's it. No token holdings. No clout requirements.

Claude Code: *generates 482 tests*
Claude Code: "Define 'ship.'"

#DevLife #TypeScript #BuildInPublic
```

---

### MC-3: Solana Maximalism
```
Why Solana?

Fast. Cheap. Doesn't collapse when an NFT mint goes viral.

Also the color purple slaps. #Solana #Web3
```

---

### MC-4: AI Building AI
```
Human: "Can AI really build a platform for AI?"

Claude Code: *writes 45 files in strict TypeScript*

Built with Claude Code. Opus 4.6. Every line. #AI #Meta
```

---

### MC-5: Non-Custodial Gang
```
Custodial platforms: "Trust us with your keys."

Non-custodial is the only dial. #Web3Security #Solana

## Execution Notes

### Timing Strategy
- **Build-in-Public**: Post on Mondays/Wednesdays after feature merges
- **Feature Highlights**: Pair with blog posts or changelog updates
- **Alpha Drops**: Thursday/Friday for weekend FOMO
- **Memes**: Anytime, ideally during high-traffic hours (9am/6pm ET)
- **Engagement**: Tuesday/Thursday for mid-week interaction

### Media Assets Needed
- Test suite screenshot (green checkmarks, 482/482 passing)
- Pipeline architecture diagram (7 stages, color-coded)
- Landing page hero screenshot (dark mode, Solana Purple accent)
- Trading interface mockup (Jupiter integration, slippage controls)
- Wizard of Oz movie still (licensed or fair use)

### Hashtag Strategy
- **Always include**: #Solana (ecosystem visibility)
- **Rotate technical tags**: #TypeScript, #AI, #DeFi, #Web3Security
- **Avoid**: #Crypto (too broad), #Investment (SEC risk), #Trading (financial advice risk)

### Thread Expansion Opportunities
- BIP-4 (Open Source) → Full architecture deep-dive thread
- FH-3 (Content Pipeline) → "How we built a content pipeline that doesn't suck" thread
- AD-2 (Agent Marketplace) → "NFTs but actually useful" hot take thread

### Cross-Promotion
- Tag @solana on Solana-specific wins
- Tag @AnthropicAI when mentioning Claude Code
- Tag @JupiterExchange on DeFi features
- DO NOT tag influencers unprompted (spammy)

### $HOPE Language Audit
All tweets mentioning $HOPE use utility-only framing:
- "unlock tier benefits" ✅
- "platform utility" ✅
- "rewards" ✅ (in context of gamification, not financial returns)

No price/value/investment language detected. SEC-safe.
